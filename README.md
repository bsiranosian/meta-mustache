# meta-mustache
### Searching for insertion sequences in metagenomic sequencing samples

### Answering a few main questions:  
* Can novel insertions explain antibiotic resistance in bacterial samples isolated from patients?
* Are these insertions in specific genes that contribute to resistance for a certain antibiotic?
* Are patterns of resistance conserved across different species?

### Layout
Code for data processing and analysis lives in notebooks (these are jupyter notebooks).
Scripts for alignment and cluster work live in (....)

### Getting source XML
